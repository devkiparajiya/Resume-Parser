This project is an AI-powered Resume Parser that extracts structured information such as Name, Email, Phone Number, Skills, Education, and Experience from resume PDFs using Natural Language Processing techniques.
The system combines rule-based methods, regular expressions, and SpaCy NER to handle real-world resume formats and improve extraction accuracy.

Working principle of this resume parser is as follows: 
1.PDF text extraction
2.NLP-based text processing
3.Anchor-based name detection
4.Rule-based information extraction
5.Structured JSON output
